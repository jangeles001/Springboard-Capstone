# Springboard-Capstone
🧠 Capstone Project Repository
This repository will host my final capstone project for [Your School/Bootcamp Name]’s [Program Name] program. The project will be a full-stack web application built with modern technologies such as React, Node.js, and a RESTful or GraphQL API.

The final topic is still under exploration, but it will focus on solving a real-world problem with an emphasis on usability, design, and code quality.

🔨 Technologies (tentative): React · JavaScript · Node.js · Express · MongoDB/PostgreSQL · CSS/Bootstrap · Docker

📅 Status: Planning Phase
📌 Updates will be posted as development progresses.
